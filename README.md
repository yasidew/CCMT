Certainly! Here's some information you can include in the README file for the CCMT (Code Complexity Measurement Tool):

# Code Complexity Measurement Tool (CCMT)

## Overview

The Code Complexity Measurement Tool (CCMT) is a Java-based utility designed to analyze and measure the complexity of source code. It employs a set of metrics and guidelines to quantify the complexity of code snippets, aiding developers in assessing and improving code maintainability.

## Features

### 1. Complexity Calculation

CCMT calculates code complexity using various metrics, including:

- Size of the executable statement (Sj)
- Type of control structure (Wc)
- Nesting level of control structure (Wn)
- Inheritance level of statements (Wi)
- Recursion complexity (Cr)
- System input-output statements complexity (Ci)
- Try-catch complexity (Ct)
- Compound conditional statements complexity (Cc)
- Array declaration complexity (Ca)

### 2. Supported Control Structures

CCMT recognizes and analyzes common control structures such as if-else statements, for and while loops, switch cases, recursion, and more.

### 3. Multi-dimensional Array Declaration

The tool handles multi-dimensional array declarations, calculating the complexity associated with array sizes.

### 4. User-friendly Interface

CCMT provides a straightforward interface for developers to input their code and receive a comprehensive complexity report.

## How to Use

1. **Input Code:**
   - Paste or input your Java code into the provided textarea.

2. **Calculate Complexity:**
   - Click the "Calculate Complexity" button to initiate the complexity analysis.

3. **View Report:**
   - The tool generates a detailed report, including individual complexities for different aspects of the code.

## Use Cases

CCMT can be useful in various scenarios, such as:

- **Code Review:**
  - Assess and understand the complexity of code during peer reviews.

- **Maintainability Analysis:**
  - Evaluate the maintainability of code to identify potential areas for improvement.

- **Educational Purposes:**
  - Aid students in understanding and visualizing code complexity metrics.
